The 3 main nutrients provided by plant fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In fact, the concentrations of these 3 nutrients are printed on the front of each package as a series of 3 numbers, sometimes called the "NPK" numbers or the fertilizer grade.
Deficiencies of these 3 minerals can be roughly diagnosed through leaf appearance. Nitrogen deficiencies lead to yellow and brown leaves; phosphorus deficiencies cause purple-veined and slow-growing leaves; potassium deficiencies lead to curled, distorted leaves.
The balance between nitrogen and potassium determines where plants focus their growth. A high nitrogen-to-potassium ratio boosts leaf growth, which is ideal for lawns, shrubs, and other plants in which foliage is desirable. A high potassium-to-nitrogen ratio will boost fruit, flower, and vegetable growth at the expense of leaf growth.
To achieve the most accurate picture of your soil's nutrient content, you can have a soil sample from your garden analyzed. In the U.S., many county extension offices can perform this test or direct you towards an organization that can.
